# Machine Learning and Statistics - Winter 21/22 Assessment

# machine-learning-and-statistics-assessment
A repository created as part of course requirements for Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with GMIT 2021

## Purpose of the Assessment
To sublit a repository that acheives the learning outcomes of the Machine Learning and Statistics Module as part of the course requirements for Higher Diploma in Data Analytics with GMIT 2021. 

The learning outcomes:

Describe the stochastic nature of real world measurement
Select an appropiate cost function for a given machine learning task
Apply a optimisation technique to the parameters of a model

## Prerequisites for the Project

Using python programming tools, this project will analyse, summise and visualise key invetigates using a number of packages. These include (Python was installed through Anaconda so some packages were already av were avaiable to me): 
  
  pandas - Installed from: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas
  
  matplotlib - Installed from: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/matplotlib
  
  numpy - Installed from: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy
  
  seaborn - Installed from: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/seaborn

  
## Investigations on the Iris Data Set:
